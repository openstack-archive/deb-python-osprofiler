===================
Integration Testing
===================

We should create DSVM job that check that proposed changes in OSprofiler
don't break projects that are using OSProfiler.


Problem description
===================

Currently we don't have CI for testing that OSprofiler changes are backward
compatible and don't break projects that are using OSprofiler. In other words
without this job each time when we are releasing OSProfiler we can break
some of OpenStack projects which is quite bad.

Proposed change
===============

Create DSVM job that will install OSprofiler with proposed patch instead of
the latest release and run some basic tests.

Alternatives
------------

Do nothing and break the OpenStack..

Implementation
