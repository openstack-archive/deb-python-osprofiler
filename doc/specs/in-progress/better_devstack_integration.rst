 Better DevStack Integration
============================

Make it simple to enable OSprofiler like it is simple to enable DEBUG log level

Problem description
===================

It's hard to turn on OSProfiler in DevStack, you have to change
notification_topic and enable Ceilometer and in future do other magic.
As well if something is done wrong it's hard to debug


Proposed change

Make a single argument: PROFILING=True/False

Alternatives
------------

Do nothing and keep things hard.
